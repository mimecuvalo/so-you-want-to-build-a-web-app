# tl;dr
- **recommendations**: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico2/)
- **ORM**: [prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
- **migrations**: schema upgrades in your source code, [gh-ost](https://github.com/github/gh-ost)
- **quick note on NoSQL**: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/), [OrbitDB](https://github.com/orbitdb)

----------

i don’t have too many things to comment on as far as databases go. they’re probably my weakest area. (i’m open to suggestions!)

# recommendations
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/): Recommendation used to be MySQL but PostgreSQL has definitely taken off community-wise.
    - a great service that provides Postgres as a service is [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).
- [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico2/): you might have grown up on phpMyAdmin 🤮. this is better.


----------
# ORM

[**prisma**](https://www.prisma.io/) is a simple layer to have your code interface with your db.

on the other hand, [there are arguments](https://blog.logrocket.com/why-you-should-avoid-orms-with-examples-in-node-js-e0baab73fa5) against using ORM’s since they can add cruft to your queries. as mentioned in the JS section about using frameworks, in general, using a higher-level wrapper doesn’t excuse you from learning how the underlying technologies works!


----------
# migrations
- in your source code, a folder containing the scripts for updating schema from version 1 to your current version is recommended. (a tool for this would be great here!)
- [gh-ost](https://github.com/github/gh-ost). for more complicated db migrations.


----------
# quick note on NoSQL

again, i’m ill-equipped to talk about db’s. but here are some options on NoSQL to explore if you’re into that kind of thing:

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/)


----------
# useful commands

(further reference on commands [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-manage-sql-database-cheat-sheet).)

for when you can’t use the GUI and have to use the command line.

- `show databases` — like it says.
- `use [database]` — enter the context of a particular database.
- `describe [table]` — show the structure of a table.
- `show create table [table]` — show how a table is created. useful to get foreign key info.
- `select * from [table] where [conditions]` — select columns in a table.
- `insert into [table] (``'``[column1]``'``,` `'``[column2]``'``) values ('[value1]', '[value2]``'``)` — insert data into a table.
- `delete from [table] where [conditions]` — to remove rows in a table.
- `exit` — leave the program.
