or, *the “the wisdom of the tee” part.*

# tl;dr
- **absolute basics**: `cd`, `ls`, `rm`, `mv`, `vim`
- **shortcuts**: [ctrl] + [a|e|c|k|z]
- **intermediate**: `|`, `history`, `grep` ([`ripgrep`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)), `cat`, `less`, `man`, `find` ([`fd`](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd)), `df`, `du` ([`dust`](https://github.com/bootandy/dust)), `sudo`, `tail`, `touch`, `alias`, `sh`, `exit`
- **processes**: `&`, `>`, `top`, `ps`, `kill`, `killall`, `which`, `locate`, `fg`
- **network**: `curl`, `whois`, `traceroute`, `ping`, `lsof`, `scp`
- **handy commands**: SSH key generation, handling archives, replacing en masse, permissions, JSON parsing, shell script checks, [`zx`](https://google.github.io/zx/)


----------

learning how to use the terminal of your computer is a console without any buttons. you are expected almost to know which “buttons” are hidden there below the surface. no one ever gave me a primer and it was painful to learn over time through trial and error what those hidden commands are. here’s a compilation of some useful commands to get you through most basic functions and some more interesting ones.

btw, god help you if you need to write [shell scripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script). ugh, i think they’re the worst syntactically. my tendency is to write node or python scripts instead because at least they make bore sense to me.


----------
# absolute basics

- `cd [name]` — change directory 
    - `~` is shorthand for your home directory
    - `..` is shorthand for the parent directory
    - `.` is shorthand for the current directory
    - `-` is shorthand for the previous directory you were in (like your browser’s “back” button)
    - e.g. `cd ..` will take you to the parent directory
- `ls` — list contents of the directory you’re in
    - `ls -lah` is useful to list hidden files as well
- `rm [file]` — remove a file
    - `rm -r [file]` — remove a directory
- `mv \[origin\] [destination]` — move a file somewhere else
    - `clear` — also, clears screen
- `vim [file]` — edit a file
    - `i` to go to insert mode
    - `esc` to go back to command-mode
    - `/` to search in the file
    - `:w` (in command mode) to save
    - `:q` (in command mode) to quit


----------
# shortcuts

this is a pet peeve of mine that no one ever taught me these *super* handy shortcuts and i didn’t know about them for many years.

[ctrl] + a — go to beginning of the line
[ctrl] + e — go to the end of the line
[ctrl] + c — kill the currently running program
[ctrl] + k — clear screen
[ctrl] + z — pause the currently running program


----------
# intermediate

- `|` — the “pipe”. pass the output from one process to another, e.g. `history | grep cd`
- `history` — see the list of commands you’ve tried in the past
- `grep [pattern] *` — search the files in the current directory for the pattern
    - *tip*: easier, faster alternative is [`ripgrep`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep), you can install via `brew install ripgrep`
- `grep [pattern] * -rsiI` — search recursively, case-insensitive, ignoring binary files
- `history | grep [pattern]` — find relevant commands in your history you’ve used before
- `cat [file]` — output the contents of a file
- `less [file]` — scroll through the contents of a file (`space`  to page through, `q` to quit)
- `man [command]` — show help file for a command, `[cmd] -h` or `[cmd] --help` also can work
- `find . -name '[file]'` — find a file by a specific name
    - *tip*: easier alternative is [`fd`](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd), you can install via `brew install f`d
- `df -h` — show local hard disk space
- `du -sch * |sort -hr` — show the biggest files under a particular subdirectory
    - *tip*: easier alternative is [`dust`](https://github.com/bootandy/dust), you can install via `brew install dust`
- `sudo [command]` — run command with [elevated privileges](https://xkcd.com/149/)
- `tail -f [file]` — see real-time updates to a file, used especially with a log file on a server
- `touch [file]` — creates file if doesn’t exist, or updates its timestamp
    - useful to kick off a process that might be waiting for a file to change before running
- `alias [shortcut]='[command to run]'` — take a long command that’s hard to remember and create a shortcut for it, e.g. `alias v='ls -lah'`
- `sh` — open up another shell (`zsh` if you’re using that)
    - `exit` — to exit the shell


----------
# processes

- `[cmd] &` — adding the ampersand at the end of a command will run it in the background
- `[cmd] > output.txt` — adding a `>` will save output of the program to a particular file
- `top` — find out what’s current running on your machine
- `ps aux`  — see the processes currently running on your machine
- `ps aux | grep [name]` — super common way to find the process you’re looking for
- `kill [process id]` — you can grab a process id from the `ps aux` list and kill it
- `killall [name]` — kill process(es) matching the name
- `which [command]` — find out the directory where a program lives
- `locate [pattern]` — find files on your local machine matching the pattern (macOS only)
- `fg` — start a paused program again (via [ctrl] + z), or, use `bg` to run it in the background


----------
# network

- `curl -O [url]` — retrieve a webpage and save it disk
- `whois [domain]` — find out info about a particular website
- `traceroute [domain]` — show computer hops from router to router to a destination
- `ping [domain]` — simple test to see if a website is up or not
    - `ping6 [domain]` — same as above, but for [IPv6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6)
- `lsof -i :[port]` — see which process is using which port.
    - `lsof -t -i tcp:[port] | xargs kill -9` — to easily kill whatever’s on a port.
- `scp username@remotehost:/path/to/file /path/to/save/locally` — copy a file from a remote server


----------
# handy commands

- `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "[example@email.com]"` — generate SSH key
- `ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa` — add password to your keychain to save time
- `tar -czvf \[name\] [file]` — compress a file/directory into an archive
- `tar -xzvf [file]` — uncompress an archive
- `grep [pattern] * -rsiIl | xargs sed -i '' s/[pattern]/[replacewith]/g` —
    - replace a pattern in all the files found recursively within a particular directory
- `sudo chown -R $USER:$USER file` — transfer ownership of a directory and its files to yourself
- `jq '[selector]' < example.json` — if your server logs are in JSON format you can query them using the `jq` command
- `fc` — fix command. open up the last command you tried to run in an editor.
- `<( somecommand )` — treat a command output as a file. e.g. try `diff <(ls) <(ls -a)`
- [`cmatrix`](https://github.com/abishekvashok/cmatrix) — make it look like you’re doing something important 😉
- [`shellcheck`](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) — check your shell script for errors before running it.
- [`zx`](https://google.github.io/zx/) — a handy JS tool *around* shell scripting that makes running multiple commands a little more intuitive for those of us that don’t live on the command line day-to-day (i.e. most of us).
