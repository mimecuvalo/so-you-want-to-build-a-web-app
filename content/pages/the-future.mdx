gonna be real, folks are just vibin' these days.
and i get it, no shade thrown here. but as they say in Inception: "we must go deeper."

then again, you should make sure you're not building the [Torment Nexus](https://buttondown.com/monteiro/archive/how-to-not-build-the-torment-nexus/)‚Ä¶

- [**Cursor**](https://cursor.com/): the new hotness.
  - [**Cursor rules**](https://github.com/PatrickJS/awesome-cursorrules?tab=readme-ov-file#contents): some Cursor rules you can peruse.
- [**Claude**](https://claude.ai/) and [**Claude Code**](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code): the LLMs that give you wings.
- [**GitHub Copilot**](https://github.com/features/copilot/): helps you write code more quickly. wield wisely though: with great power‚Ä¶ comes less understanding of the underlying principles üòâ

# everything old is new again

so, this guide is obviously about writing complex apps with ‚Äúthick‚Äù clients that have javascript running browser-side. however, there is a trend to go back to ‚Äúhow things used to be‚Äù with thinner clients and running things more on the server-side. these thought leaders aren‚Äôt necessarily wrong! we‚Äôve been oscillating between server‚Üíclient‚Üíserver and i think this is a healthy criticism on how things maybe have gotten out of hand on the complexity of frontend projects (i mean, hell, i had to write this whole guide meant to navigate this complex landscape!)

here are tech projects to watch as this trend continues:

- [htmx](https://htmx.org/)
- [hotwire](https://hotwired.dev/)
- [remix](https://remix.run/)

if you wanna read an *absolutely brutal* takedown of the current untenable, complex state of frontend read [The Market for Lemons](https://infrequently.org/2023/02/the-market-for-lemons/).

# decentralization


<YouTube href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nJVW_DqLntg" />


our current Internet has become highly centralized, with your data being held up in silos like Facebook, Twitter, and the like. imagine how *incredibly stupid* it would be if you used Gmail but your friend used Yahoo‚Äôs mail and you couldn‚Äôt email each other because you used different services. email works because it *doesn‚Äôt care* what service or your friend picked: it nevertheless lets you communicate with others using different companies.


[![The X-Files](/img/x-files.jpg "right-33")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X-Files)


now think of how *insanely dumb* it is that just because you choose MySpace, another friend chooses Friendster, and yet another friend chooses Facebook, you cannot communicate, share photos and ‚Äúbe friends‚Äù. (all this, of course, is on top of the fact that a lot of these sites profit off of you and your data.) we need to work hard to think of a world that lets users break down these corporate walls and offer interoperability with each other, instead of siloing people into a single service.

i‚Äôve been following (and [contributing](https://github.com/mimecuvalo/helloworld)) the work of decentralization, the work to make the Internet as it was intended to be. while it‚Äôs made great strides in recent years, it has a long way to go and definitely could use your help and passion. it behooves you to start thinking ahead to a world where your users don‚Äôt feel stuck to the platform you‚Äôre creating.

here are some efforts currently underway that are interesting to follow:

- [Fediverse](https://fediverse.party/): meta collection of projects
- [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/)
