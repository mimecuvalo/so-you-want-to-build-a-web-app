# intro

after several cycles of scrubbing out bugs and fine-tuning your spectacular app, you‚Äôre going to start realizing that you‚Äôre running into the same class of bugs and problems. or, maybe you know all the pitfalls of your code, but the other members of the your team don‚Äôt and inadvertently create bugs. regardless of the reason, a robust testing methodology baked into your coding will help provide a safety net for all the things that could go wrong as you add more and more code to the app. (if the act of debugging your code is removing problems, then the act of programming must be the act of adding them in, eh? üòõ)


----------
# testing framework

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) is built on top of the mature [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) project to be zero-configuration and *much faster* than its predecessor. it‚Äôs built at Facebook so it also works really well with React which is the main recommendation of this guide as well.


## getting setup

to create tests, you create `.js` files within folders named `__tests__`. alternatively, you can create files with a `.test.js` or `.spec.js` suffix. it comes bundled with create-next-app by default. if it isn‚Äôt installed you can do so via:

```sh
npm install --save-dev jest
```


## how to write basic tests

the basic form of a test involves just asserting that something is true or not. for example:

```js
it('sums numbers', () => {
    expect(sum(1, 2)).toEqual(3);
    expect(sum(2, 2)).toEqual(4);
});
```


## testing components

to give you the ability to test React components, the [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) helps put simplify test writing.


## coverage

to get a measurement on your code to see much your tests are actually examining your code, you can do the following:

```sh
npm test -- --coverage  # (note extra -- in the middle)
```

a widely-used product in this space that you can utilize is [coveralls](https://coveralls.io/). i hear good things about [codecov](https://about.codecov.io/) too but haven‚Äôt tested it yet.


## debugging tests in Chrome

you can debug your tests via `about:inspect` URL in your Chrome browser. learn more on this technique [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/debugging-tests).


## playground

here‚Äôs a [handy playground](https://testing-playground.com/) for creating and testing UI.


----------
# canary server

mentioned in [CI section](/workflow-and-collaboration#continuous-integration---continuous-deployment--CI-CD-) is the fact that you can setup a server so that you can ‚Äúdogfood‚Äù your app before it goes out to the public. testing can catch a lot of things but sometimes new classes of errors can only crop up with real-world use.


----------
# browser automation and end-to-end (e2e) testing

the latest hotness here is [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer). this lets you automate your browser to navigate through your app by simulating clicking and typing into the browser. save this kind of testing for the very end ‚Äî it‚Äôs thoroughly involved and expensive to maintain ‚Äî only very mature projects should consider this route. if you do start browser automation, you should also consider sticking to just one browser (either Chrome or Firefox). automating multiple browsers will only compound your headaches with this work! (historically, there was a project called PhantomJS and in the Firefox realm you have [Selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org/) testing.)

[cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) has also been making splashes here ‚Äî haven‚Äôt tested it yet but looks great.
same goes for [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) ‚Äî i‚Äôm looking to evaluate that as well soon.


----------
# screenshot testing: the white whale

i‚Äôve personally tried over the years to maintain several tests suites involving screenshot testing and they usually all go to hell. if there‚Äôs one thing i would try to steer you away from it would be this. save yourself tears and from tearing out your hair ‚Äî it‚Äôs not worth it. if you‚Äôre really bent on doing this you can check out [Huxley](https://github.com/facebookarchive/huxley) although i haven‚Äôt personally tried this library *and* even Facebook has archived this project, which tells you something. as an alternative, another [article](https://medium.com/bleeding-edge/screenshot-testing-with-react-and-storybook-19ab7e49ec92) recommends using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) but, again, i‚Äôm going to stress that you shouldn‚Äôt go this route ‚Äî there be dragons!

# others
- [**jest-dom**](https://github.com/gnapse/jest-dom): provides some custom jest matchers to help reducing repetition in tests.
- [**Sikuli Script**](http://www.sikuli.org/): something to mention ‚Äî this is actually hard to test with but it helps create automated scripts for your OS which can help for complex tasks that span across applications. in addition, it creates native OS-level inputs vs. simulated ones that Selenium does.
- [**Appium**](http://appium.io/): for native, mobile device testing.
- [**Sauce Labs**](https://saucelabs.com/): a third-party service and great way to test your product across different browsers.
