# JS, ahem, I mean TS for newbies

despite the image at the top of this section, i ❤ javascript (typescript) so hard (tbh, typescript has taken over!). i’ve been coding in it since the 90’s and it’s only gotten better over the years.

if you’re absolutely new to JS, start [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web) at the Mozilla Developer Network (or MDN). they’re the people that make Firefox and have the best reference guides for JS. in general though this guide assumes you’ve got a base understanding of JS so go forth and mess around with the language as much as you can before moving on to the rest of the more complicated stuff.

## playgrounds

an easy way to get started is by checking out some of these tools that let you play around with the language. another great way is to a project that you like and checking out it’s code. view the source, luke!

- [**CodeSandbox**](https://codesandbox.io/s/new): lets you mess around with a React app in real-time.
- [**CodePen**](https://codepen.io/): a social development environment for front-end designers and developers.
- **`node`’s** [**REPL**](https://nodejs.org/api/repl.html): most coding environments provide something called a REPL which lets you mess around with the code on the command line. just type in `node` on your command line and you should be able to try out some random code.
- [**Glitch**](https://glitch.com/): friendly community to learn and play around with code.
- [**RunKit**](https://runkit.com/home#notebooks): much like node’s REPL but online with some fancy UI.
- **npm sandboxing**: you can take any package from [npm](https://npmjs.com) and play around with it to see what it does:
```sh
mkdir sandbox
cd sandbox
npm init -y       # create an npm project. -y means use defaults
npm install --save <package name>
```


----------
# developer tools

to be able to use JS effectively, you’ll need to have a set of tools to give you visibility into what’s happening and fiddle with your code. this is the absolute best way to learn. read the section on [Chrome DevTools](/debugging#Chrome-DevTools) to learn how those tools can help you.


----------
# react + (facebook) friends

let’s get something straight: vanilla JS is something you absolutely should know. you need to understand the underlying principles and fundamentals of the frameworks you’ll be using so that you can effectively use them.

that being said, practically speaking, you won’t be writing vanilla JS a lot of the time and a well-chosen suite of frameworks will help immensely in your quest. a lot of the best of breed frameworks have come from a Cambrian explosion emanating from Facebook’s developer team. Google has tried through many, many, iterations to provide compelling alternatives but we should have seen the downward trend with frameworks ever since they started with the ill-conceived [GWT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Web_Toolkit). (i say this with love, y’all, since i used to work at Google. their contributions to browser tech and tools are amazing, but their frameworks have always been lagging.)

## [React](https://react.dev/)

*the* way to write your application these days. if there’s one place to make sure you devour all the documentation, it’s here. go through the tutorials and starter guides (using [`create-next-app`](/javascript#create-next-app), mentioned in a section of its own below, is also a good leg-up.)

[**JSX**](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)
a compelling feature that comes bundled with React is it’s ability to describe HTML and custom components *within* JS itself. this was high heresy not long ago (much like CSS-in-JS is still heresy in lots of circles but gaining traction.)

an example:

```js
const element = <h1 className="greeting">Hello, world!</h1>;
```

underneath the hood, the code will be transformed into:

```js
const element = React.createElement(
  'h1',
  {className: 'greeting'},
  'Hello, world!'
);
```

**tips**

- you don’t need to `import React` anymore directly with version 17+ to get JSX working.
- adding `React.StrictMode` to your tree can help you with migrations.


## [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)

GraphQL is a language that lets your client talk to the server to get data it needs in an efficient and forward-compatible way. there’s a lot to learn here and since it can be some of the more mind-bending stuff to learn in the React-verse, i recommend checking out this [**great intro tutorial**](https://www.robinwieruch.de/graphql-apollo-server-tutorial/) to let your brain wraparound how it works.

as an alternative, [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) is a lighter weight option, less fully featured but an easier integration.

[**Apollo**](http://apollographql.com/)
because GraphQL can be complex there are some great frameworks built around it. i recommend using Apollo to get you up and running with GraphQL quickly. to install:

```sh
npm i graphql graphql-tools graphql-tag apollo-server-express @apollo/client body-parser express
```

in addition, check out:

- [**Apollo DevTools**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/apollo-client-developer-t/jdkknkkbebbapilgoeccciglkfbmbnfm)
- **Robin Wieruch’s** [**server**](https://www.robinwieruch.de/graphql-apollo-server-tutorial/) **and** [**client**](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-graphql-apollo-tutorial/) **tutorials**: great intro tutorials for GraphQL and Apollo (by the way, i don’t recommend reading Apollo’s default tutorial ([here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/introduction.html), if you’re interested) — that one is overly complex and annoying to follow.)

[**gRPC**](https://grpc.io/)
in general, i would agree with [this StackOverflow blog post](https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/11/28/when-to-use-grpc-vs-graphql/) about when to use GraphQL and when to use gRPC: “Use GraphQL for client-server communication and gRPC for server-to-server.”


## `<strike>`React Redux`</strike>`

probably the more cultish side of the React-verse 😛. you’ll find a lot of acolytes and haters here. i actually might not recommend Redux for you, at least not off the bat. it’s another one of those mind-bending parts of the React world that can be a lot to take in. besides, even the creator suggests that sometimes [it can be unnecessary](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367). furthermore, Dan Abramov went on to say:

<Twitter href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1191495127358935040" />


but also 🙂:

<Twitter href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1191502257579347968" />



## [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)

allows you to build native mobile apps using React. i don’t have much experience here but i hear good things and that it’s getting better over time. related libraries that are of interest: [Expo](https://expo.dev/), [Yoga](https://yogalayout.com/), [Flutter](https://flutter.io/). a great starter library is [Tamagui](https://tamagui.dev/).


## looking forward

[server components](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/12/21/data-fetching-with-react-server-components.html): interesting tact to address bundle size and performance for fetching data.


----------
# `create-next-app`

there’s a lot that goes into a javascript app these days. *a lot*. to that end, we’re gonna use the `create-next-app` tool to quickly get set up. `create-next-app` helps bundle together a lot of the popular tools that are part of modern development. i’ll get into what React is in the first place in a section below this one.

## installation

first, make sure you have `[node](https://nodejs.org)`, which is a JavaScript runtime:

```sh
brew install node
```

installing `create-next-app`:

```sh
npx create-next-app@latest
cd <name-of-your-new-project>
npm start
```

as an alternative, for this guide, i’ve created an even more comprehensive version of `create-next-app` called [`all-the-things`](https://github.com/mimecuvalo/all-the-things) that adds even more tools straight out of the box.

```sh
yarn create next-app --typescript --example https://github.com/mimecuvalo/all-the-things
```

## usage

```sh
npm start             # run development server
                        # to run with https, do HTTPS=true npm start
npm run build         # build production files
npm test              # Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
```

you’ll find several folders and properties that are relevant to you:

- **public**: let’s you add assets that you don’t need compiled by webpack. this doesn’t necessarily mean images. learn more [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/static-assets).
- **src**: contains all the files you need for your app. you’ll mostly be coding in here.
    - index.js: the main entry point for your code. webpack is pointed to this file by default.
- **environment variables**: on top of the folders, you’ll also have environment variables in your control to pass in various settings to your app depending on the current environment. learn more [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables).
## pulling back the curtain

there’s a lot of magic that `create-next-app` brings to the table. the bundler acts as the glue for these packages. let’s look at the different things that come bundled in `create-next-app` by default.

- [**Babel**](https://babeljs.io/): a transpiler that lets you use [future JavaScript features](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/learn) today so that it’s supported by current browsers. you’ll hear these being called things like “ES6” or “ESNext” when talking about future versions of JS. (of note: object destructuring/spread, classes, async/await and much more).
- [**ESLint**](https://eslint.org/): checks the JS for code-quality rules (e.g. no-unused-vars, no-implicit-globals, etc.).
- [**Jest**](https://jestjs.io/): gives you some pretty great JS testing. use by running `npm test`.
    - coverage reporting: will show how much of your code is covered by tests.
- [**PostCSS**](https://postcss.org/): enables lots of nice CSS capabilities, including the following:
    - [**postcss-preset-env**](https://preset-env.cssdb.org/features)**:** lets you use new/experimental (stage 3+) CSS features today. this depends on your `browserslist` field in `package.json`. (historical note: postcss-preset-env was previously known as “cssnext”)
    - [**autoprefixing**](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer#autoprefixer-): adds compatibility support for different browsers.
    - [**CSS Modules**](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules): let’s you import CSS into your JS. name your css files `*.module.css` to take advantage.
- [**Progressive Web App (PWA) with Service Worker**](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/): gives your app offline capability and faster loading times (*note*: disabled by default. you can enable in `index.js` by switching `serviceWorker.unregister();` to be `serviceWorker.register();`.)
- [**React**](https://reactjs.org/) + [**JSX**](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html): obviously 🙂.
- [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
- other misc features:
    - **error overlay**: if there’s a compile, lint, or type error, a helpful overlay on the site will show what’s wrong.
    - [**hot module replacement**](https://nextjs.org/docs/architecture/fast-refresh) **(HMR)**: when you change the code during development the new changes will be reflected in your browser, preserving the current state.
    - **minifier**: in production, reduces the size of the code bundle as much as possible.
    - **obfuscation**: in production, mangles the variables/functions of your code so it’s unreadable.
    - [**absolute imports**](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/absolute-imports-and-module-aliases): don’t have to do `import foo from '../../../../foo'` anymore.

# security

as mentioned in [+🛠️ tools of the trade: security](/tools-of-the-trade#security), every engineer is a security engineer. you need to act like it and protect your app from the forces acting against you.

in addition to the protections at the server level, there are some things to implement at the application level as well. this is called “[defense in depth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_in_depth_(computing))”, adding multiple layers of security to protect yourself.


- **escaping user data** (via **React)**: the easiest, most common mistake is taking user-submitted data to your site and spitting it out somewhere else. a user can easily submit malicious HTML/JS that would then attack other users on the site. you can take a great stride to avoiding this by using a framework, like React, that escapes user data by default.
- **data validation**: i can’t recommend a particular framework/library here but you should take care to validate that the data you get from your users is what you expect it to be. if you’re expecting a date like `10/12/2012` but instead get `alert(1)` you should call shenanigans.
- [**bcrypt**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt): if you need to deal with passwords on your site, this library should be in your toolset.
- [**reCAPTCHA**](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/v3.html): if you need to deal with bots, this tool from Google will help [prove if you’re a robot or not](https://youtu.be/en5_JrcSTcU?t=337).
- **npm package security**: you never really know what possibly malicious code you’re pulling in to your repository via npm. one way to help combat this attack vector is using exact versioning. set this by doing `npm config set save-exact true`
- [**subresource integrity**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity): when including external scripts, you can add a hash via the `integrity` attribute. this verifies that the script hasn’t changed behind your back.

fun articles to read (to make you more paranoid):

- [I’m harvesting credit card numbers and passwords from your site. Here’s how.](https://hackernoon.com/im-harvesting-credit-card-numbers-and-passwords-from-your-site-here-s-how-9a8cb347c5b5)
- [Q: Why Do Keynote Speakers Keep Suggesting That Improving Security Is Possible?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajGX7odA87k)
- [All the ways security](https://html5sec.org) has historically gone wrong in browsers 😮

# libraries of interest

if there’s one thing that will last after the earth is gone, it’ll be cockroaches and js libraries. there are *so many* of them. try not to overdo it, because with each library you add, you become beholden to it.

**some brief recommendations, as of 2023**

- ***not*** **jQuery**. jQuery has served the JS community well over the years but its time is passed. avoid.
- [**lodash**](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.11): a handy library to help manipulate data structures among other capabilities. this is an alternative to the other popular package `underscore`.
- [**classnames**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames): i know, this is a tiny library compared to the other ones but so handy. helps with setting classes conditionally for an element.
- [**react-intl**](https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl/wiki#getting-started): internationalization (i18n).
- [**Jest**](https://jestjs.io/): testing libraries.
- [**Prettier**](https://prettier.io): linting (+ [import sorting](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier-plugin-import-sort)).
- [**Socket.io**](https://socket.io/): provides a persistent, real-time connection client ↔ server. alternatively, i hear good things about [SockJS](https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-client).
- [**Hammer.js**](https://hammerjs.github.io/): provides touch gesture (mobile) support for your app.
- [**Luxon**](https://moment.github.io/luxon/) **(**[**Temporal**](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/cookbook.html) ****soonish**)**: date/times are surprisingly complicated. this library manages that. used to be Moment.js. the next *native* library to watch out for here is [Temporal](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/cookbook.html).
- [**immer**](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/): in case you need immutability with your data objects
- [**Stripe**](https://stripe.com/): ecommerce/payments.
- [**PostHog**](https://posthog.com/) (maybe [Highlight](https://www.highlight.io/)?): analytics.
- [**Tina**](https://tina.io/)**,** [**Sanity**](https://www.sanity.io/)**,** [**Payload**](https://payloadcms.com/)**,** [**DatoCMS**](https://www.datocms.com/)**,** [**Builder**](https://www.builder.io/)[:](https://www.builder.io/) CMS — lots of options, i think Tina is doing something interesting.
- [**crawlee**](https://crawlee.dev/)**,** [**puppeteer-heap-snapshot**](https://www.adriancooney.ie/blog/web-scraping-via-javascript-heap-snapshots?utm_source=hackernewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=code): scraping.
- [**tesseract.js**](https://tesseract.projectnaptha.com/): OCR.
- [**react-hook-form**](https://react-hook-form.com/): forms.
- [**driver.js**](https://driverjs.com/): onboarding UI.
- [**GitHub Actions**](https://github.com/features/actions)**,** [**Trigger**](https://trigger.dev/): cron.
- [**pino**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pino): logging.
- [**sandworm**](https://sandworm.dev/)**,** [**socket**](https://socket.dev/): security.

**other notes**

- by the way, there are other libraries smattered throughout this guide (e.g. [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)) but those are more frameworks to “buy into” vs. handy tools that you can pull into a particular file.
- to create your own libraries, there exists [create-react-library](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/create-react-library) and its companion repository, [react-modern-library-boilerplate](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/react-modern-library-boilerplate).
