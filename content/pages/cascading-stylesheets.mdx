# CSS for newbies

if you‚Äôre absolutely new to CSS, start [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web) at the Mozilla Developer Network (or MDN). they‚Äôre the people that make Firefox and have the best reference guides for CSS. in general though this guide assumes you‚Äôve got a base understanding of CSS so go forth and mess around with the language as much as you can before moving on to the rest of the more complicated stuff.

## playgrounds

an easy way to get started is by checking out some of these tools that let you play around with the language:

- [**CodeSandbox**](https://codesandbox.io/s/new): lets you mess around with a React app in real-time.
- [**CodePen**](https://codepen.io/): a social development environment for front-end designers and developers.
- [**CSS Zen Garden**](http://csszengarden.com/): shows you how a single HTML page can look a *1,000* different ways. this site goes way back and was inspiration to many a designer/developer. (you can mess around with the CSS via the Developer Tools in your browser.)


## defining colors, a minor note

there‚Äôs been a *lot* of standards around color, beginning with `rgb` and including other fancier things like `hsl`. the new ‚Äúking‚Äù of color definition is `[oklch](https://chriscoyier.net/2023/01/22/ok-oklch-%F0%9F%91%91/)`.

# beyond CSS: CSS Modules and CSS-in-JS

this guide is about writing an *application* not a regular webpage. to that end, you shouldn‚Äôt be using regular CSS with <style> tags anymore ‚Äî as your application grows and more contributors add to it, you will drown in a sea of madness and salty tears. yes, your mother taught you to wash behind your ears, brush your teeth, and never, *EVER* use inline styles in your HTML. but those days are over and a new era has come.

the truth is that this space is still rapidly in development and the dust isn‚Äôt quite settled yet. i think there are compelling arguments for both CSS-in-JS and CSS Modules. you‚Äôll probably fine going with either these days.


## CSS Modules: a happy middle ground

[CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) are a great way to get a lot of the benefits of CSS-in-JS without leaving the CSS world altogether. here‚Äôs a [helpful primer](https://glenmaddern.com/articles/css-modules) on getting started.


## CSS-in-JS: some compelling arguments

CSS-in-JS forgoes CSS files altogether and says we should have our styling where our components are. think about it this way. when you‚Äôre sharing HTML these days, we tend to do so via *HTML-in-JS*. in other words, one can create React components and publish them to the general web to share to fellow developers. similarly, one could argue, the best way to share CSS is to package them inside of something standard like JS.

**great reads on the topic**

- [**Farewell CSS**](https://moox.io/blog/farewell-css/): a great take on why you should probably be doing CSS-in-JS.
- [**CSS in JS**](https://speakerdeck.com/vjeux/react-css-in-js)[:](https://speakerdeck.com/vjeux/react-css-in-js) a watershed moment of a slideshow arguing for you to forget everything you now about how inline styles are bad.
- [**A Unified Styling Language**](https://medium.com/seek-blog/a-unified-styling-language-d0c208de2660): from the co-creator of CSS modules, an argument for CSS-in-JS and to leave behind things like BEM which are only conventions/opt-in vs. something that‚Äôs baked-in to a methodology.

**package options**
again, there‚Äôs so much action going on in this space that it‚Äôs still to be decided what paradigm will win here. for now though, my tentative recommendation is [emotion](https://emotion.sh/).

- [**emotion**](https://emotion.sh/): rapidly in development, new to the party. ‚Äúnext-gen‚Äù.
- [**styled-components**](https://www.styled-components.com/): personally, i‚Äôm not a fan since it requires bundling a CSS parser. bleh.
- [**glamorous**](https://glamorous.rocks/): uses objects in JS to declare CSS for a particular module.
- [**Aphrodite**](https://github.com/Khan/aphrodite): uses objects and lets you do server-side rendering, too.
- [**vanilla-extract**](https://vanilla-extract.style/)
- [**polished**](https://polished.js.org/): lets you write CSS rules in a more semantic way. the ‚Äúlodash‚Äù of CSS-in-JS.
- [**Linaria**](https://github.com/callstack/linaria): zero-runtime CSS in JS.
- [**styletron**](http://styletron.js.org/): has some smart optimizations around CSS generation.
- [**JSS**](http://cssinjs.org): one of the original packages ‚Äî uses a dynamic stylesheet to add rules. (you‚Äôll need [react-jss](http://cssinjs.org/react-jss/?v=v8.6.1) as well.)
- [**Radium**](https://formidable.com/open-source/radium/): one of the original packages in this space.
- [**Atomic CSS**](https://acss.io/): bleh. unreadable.
- to help you decide: [an article](https://hackernoon.com/all-you-need-to-know-about-css-in-js-984a72d48ebc) going over (some of) the various libraries.

# create-next-app

related to the [previous section on JS](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/javascript--ARW2fKhq0ia6O_FwQYPXtVxEAg-E6hvmTcdbsZbZOJUcePQt), i‚Äôll mention again here the technologies included by default related to CSS for you to use out of the box.


- [**PostCSS**](https://postcss.org/): enables lots of nice CSS capabilities, including the following:
    - [**postcss-preset-env**](https://preset-env.cssdb.org/features)**:** lets you use new/experimental (stage 3+) CSS features today. this depends on your `browserslist` field in `package.json`. (historical note: postcss-preset-env was previously known as ‚Äúcssnext‚Äù)
    - [**autoprefixing**](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer#autoprefixer-): adds compatibility support for different browsers.
    - [**CSS Modules**](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules): let‚Äôs you import CSS into your JS. name your css files `*.module.css` to take advantage.
- [**Sass**](https://sass-lang.com/guide): provides support for a superset of CSS. (*note*: disabled by default. needs to be turned on by installing the `node-sass` package.)


## CSS Reset

[**sanitize.css**](https://csstools.github.io/sanitize.css/) is a CSS Reset that helps normalize things across browsers, a lesser problem these days but still important.


## conventions

**CSS Modules**
when you can, it‚Äôs suggested to use CSS Modules which provide great scoping for your CSS to a particular JS module. first, name your CSS file `[name].module.css` and then you can use it in your JS module as such (take note of the `composes` keyword and what it‚Äôs doing):

    // Button.module.css
    .className {
      color: green;
      background: red;
    }
    
    .otherClassName {
      composes: className;
      color: yellow;
    }


    // Button.js
    import React, { Component } from 'react';
    import styles from './Button.module.css'; // Import css modules stylesheet as styles
    import './another-stylesheet.css'; // Import regular stylesheet
    
    class Button extends Component {
      render() {
        // reference as a js object
        return <button className={styles.otherClassName}>Button</button>;
      }
    }


----------
# preprocessors

given the recommendation for CSS Modules/CSS-in-JS i might steer you away from CSS preprocessors (which would add yet another layer top of an already complex stack of technologies). but, if that‚Äôs your thing, then take a look at [**Sass**](https://sass-lang.com/).

the advantages Sass can give you are things like:

- variables
- nesting of rules
- mixins
- operators
- and [more](https://sass-lang.com/guide)!

(*historical note*: other packages in the space are things like [Less](http://lesscss.org/) but the community isn‚Äôt as strong there and the support from other vendors isn‚Äôt as robust.)

# looking ahead

there‚Äôs a bunch of CSS features constantly in the making. let‚Äôs look at a couple of more interesting ones that are in the pipeline (as of Fall 2018) and/or are currently in the wild for you to try:


- [**custom variables**](https://preset-env.cssdb.org/features#custom-properties): this is already pretty much out in the wild. let‚Äôs you specify variables much like you would in Sass or LESS.
- [**grid**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid): simplifies existing layout patterns. here are some sites showing off its capabilities:
    - [CSS Grid Garden](http://cssgridgarden.com/)
    - [Intro to CSS grids](https://labs.jensimmons.com/#intro-grid)
    - [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/CSS_Grid_and_Progressive_Enhancement#Starting_to_use_Grid_in_production)
        - [MDN inspirational examples](https://www.mozilla.org/developer/css-grid/?utm_source=gridtooltip&utm_medium=devtools&utm_campaign=cssgrid_layout)
    - [Grid by Example](https://gridbyexample.com/examples/)
- [**all: initial**](https://preset-env.cssdb.org/features#all-property): lets you reset the properties of an element.
- [**contain**](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/06/css-containment): not widely supported yet but can ostensibly give you some performance gains during rendering.
- [**will-change**](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/animations/animations-and-performance#using_the_will-change_property): gives a performance hint to the browser on how a particular element will change over time.
- [**scroll-snap-align**](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/07/css-scroll-snap): a way to give some control over scroll behavior to align with certain anchor points.

*(and* [*many more*](https://preset-env.cssdb.org/features) *to come‚Ä¶)*
