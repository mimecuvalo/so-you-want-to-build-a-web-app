or, *the "working with others" part.*
*(even if that other person is just your future self trying to understand WTF your code does years later).*

# repository
## [git](https://git-scm.com/)

`git` is the way we‚Äôll save code and how we can enable collaborating with others in the future. [GitHub](https://github.com/) has become almost synonymous with git as its most widely used implementor of the technology.

first, initialize a repository:

    git init [projectname]

**basic commands**
`git help [command]` ‚Äî for help on any particular command. or just `git help`.
`git clone [url]` ‚Äî copy a repository to your local machine.
`git status` ‚Äî get the state of your repository.
`git pull` ‚Äî get the latest state of your repository from the central repository.
`git push` ‚Äî push out your changes to the central repository.

    `git pull` `--``rebase` ‚Äî i tend to use the `--rebase` flag to not have thousands of ‚Äúmerge‚Äù commits in history.

`git log` ‚Äî show the history of the repository. optionally, you can specify a branch name.

    `git log --stat` ‚Äî a more detailed view into the log.

`git branch` ‚Äî manage different versions of your repository.

    `git branch -D` ‚Äî delete the branch.

`git add [file]` ‚Äî add a particular file to the pending commit.
`git reset [file]` ‚Äî remove a file from the pending commit.
`git mv \[orig\] [dest]` ‚Äî move a file in your repository.
`git rm [file]` ‚Äî remove a file from your repository.
`git commit` ‚Äî create an entry with your latest work.

    add `-a` to add all current files.

`git checkout [branch]` ‚Äî switch to another branch.

    `git checkout -b [branch]` ‚Äî create the branch.

`git checkout [file]` ‚Äî checkout the original copy of the file.
`git diff` ‚Äî show differences made to the current branch.

    `git diff > patch.diff` ‚Äî to create a diff of your current branch.
    `patch -p[0|1] patch.diff` ‚Äî to apply your previously saved patch.

`git revert [commit hash]` ‚Äî undo a particular commit.
`git stash` ‚Äî to put away your current work temporarily. *super handy.*

    `git stash pop` ‚Äî to retrieve the work you stashed.
    `git stash drop` ‚Äî to throw away your changes.

if you installed `zsh` and `oh-my-zsh` (from the [+üõ†Ô∏è tools of the trade](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/tools-of-the-trade-3HTOU368TrXVOAhffEQz8) chapter) then you‚Äôll have some handy dandy shortcuts in your shell already, check them out here:

    cat ~/.oh-my-zsh/plugins/git/git.plugin.zsh
    
    # my commonly used ones are:
    gst # git status
    gb  # git branch
    gc  # git commit
    gco # git checkout
    gd  # git diff
    gp  # git push

**other useful commands**
`git grep [pattern]` ‚Äî search for files that match a particular pattern.
`git bisect` ‚Äî enables a for a bug regression in your codebase by checking out previous versions of your project in piecemeal fashion.
`git show [commit hash]` ‚Äî show a particular commit or object.
`git cherry-pick [commit hash]` ‚Äî grab a commit from another branch.

    especially useful when trying to hotfix a production branch.

`git rebase / merge` ‚Äî merge work with others.

    probably the hardest part of dealing with a repository.
    you should read up more on this before using.
    as noted above you can use `git pull` `--``rebase` to make your workflow somewhat easier.

`git ls-files` ‚Äî list out the files in your repository. use with `grep` to be useful.
`git blame [file]` ‚Äî useful to see the history of each line in a file.
`git reflog` ‚Äî useful in case you think you lost some work accidentally. you probably didn‚Äôt.

    read the docs for more info on how to use and get your work back.

`git config --global push.default current` ‚Äî so you don‚Äôt have to do `--set-upstream` all the time.

for bigger teams you might consider looking at You can combine packages like [Commitizen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commitizen) and [Semantic Release](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semantic-release) to help you with versioning and maintaining a changelog.

**pull requests**

- [**squash and merge**](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/configuring-commit-squashing-for-pull-requests): recommend to use squashing so that all the many commits from individual PRs don‚Äôt pollute the main branch‚Äôs git history.

**gui‚Äôs**
if you‚Äôre into this sort of thing (and your editor/IDE doesn‚Äôt support repository manipulation), you can look at standalone applications:

- [GitHub](https://desktop.github.com/)
- [list of others](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis)

**signing**
for an extra verification layer for your commits, you can [sign your commits](https://help.github.com/en/articles/managing-commit-signature-verification) via GPG. NOTE: on OS X you‚Äôll need to [follow some extra steps](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39494631/gpg-failed-to-sign-the-data-fatal-failed-to-write-commit-object-git-2-10-0) to hack around it not working üòï 

## package management

`[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)` is your tool to enable you to install work from others on the internet. why invent the wheel and there are probably already [14 packages](https://xkcd.com/927/) that have done it for you!

first, initialize `npm` in your git repository: ([reference](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install))

    npm init

answer the questions and you should get package.json at the end of it. next, install the packages you need via these commands:

    npm install [package]
    
    # or, to specify a dependency type
    npm install --save\[dev|prod|optional\] [package]
    npm install --production [package]    # to install on prod

to uninstall a package:

    npm uninstall [package]

alternatively, there is also [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), which is pretty much equivalent to npm these days.

**tips**

- as a security precaution, use `--save-exact` to ensure your package doesn‚Äôt get updated without auditing behind your back (not to mention making the package version consistent with others on your team)
- use [npm-check-updates](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates) (or `ncu`) to keep your packages up-to-date.
    - a great visual way to run `ncu` is: `ncu --interactive --format group,repo`


## directory structure

a good structure for your project lays out the initial strokes to make organizing your small project to (maybe) one day be a larger project. [this template](https://github.com/mimecuvalo/all-the-things/tree/master/packages/react-scripts/template) is just one way of doing things but can be a great way to kick off your project.

**editor consistency**
also, using something like `[.gitattributes](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes)` can be useful to make sure things like line-endings are consistent. e.g.:

    * text=auto eol=lf


## security
- [**git secrets**](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets): ensure secrets don‚Äôt get committed to code


## multi-package

if you have a larger organization/multiple projects under the same umbrella, do check out [turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) or [nx](https://nx.dev/). both have great tools. these tools are the next generation after things like Lerna.

# collaboration
## with yourself

this sounds silly, right? but you may be your own worst enemy sometimes when it comes to getting shit done. because coding is an inherently creative exercise, it requires being able to set aside time to get into the [*state of flow*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)) (or, ‚Äúin the zone‚Äù). here‚Äôs a list of things to help you focus on the task at hand:

- **email:**
    - **once/twice a day**: your physical mail comes once a day at your house‚Äôs mailbox, you process it and move on with your life. go through your email in the morning and maybe after lunch, close that tab, and move on. if people need to get to you faster they can get you through IM/Slack.
    - **filters**: aggressively create filters to hide unimportant emails.
    - **never on weekends**: YOLO as the kids say.
    - **inbox zero** (or maybe inbox four üôÇ): go through your inbox and respond, delete, delegate, or defer. YMMV on this ‚Äî some people love it, some people think it‚Äôs an excessively strict philosophy that sets one up for failure.
- **maker time:**
    - **block off time on your calendar**: put blocks of time on your calendar stating ‚Äúmaker time‚Äù or ‚Äúdo not schedule‚Äù. this is especially true as you grow in your career and responsibilities.
    - **no meeting wednesday**: this worked great at my previous company. it meant no one could schedule meetings which created a culture of maker time. i would argue thursday should also be no meetings, too, but that was a tough sell.
    - **one late night a week**: having a solid chunk of time to get into that flow state is crucial. work out with yourself and/or partner to give yourself time to work uninterrupted.
    - **one/two weeks a year to experiment**: if you can afford it, give yourself time to blow off steam during the year to experiment and learn something different. your work/company probably will [benefit from it](https://blogs.dropbox.com/dropbox/2015/08/hack-week-2015/)!
- **headphones**: a great signal to others to leave you alone to your work. let others know this if it‚Äôs not understood.
- **hide**: i‚Äôm only half-kidding. üòõ

if you want to go deeper on this topic you can take a look at this more in-depth look at "[Deep Work](https://todoist.com/inspiration/deep-work)‚Äù.


## with others

there‚Äôs lots of ways to collaborate with others. sometimes it can be a bit much but it‚Äôs useful to learn the different tools!

**tools**

- **email**: obviously. use for lower latency communication, i.e. 24 hour response would be ok.
- **irc**: for quick communication. the kids are all into it these days in the form of [Slack](https://slack.com/).
- **wiki**: [Dropbox Paper](https://paper.dropbox.com). (i‚Äôm biased because i worked on this before. üòá) write down your tribal knowledge that‚Äôs floating around in people‚Äôs heads. [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) is also well loved.
- **issue tracker/planning**: [Linear](https://linear.app/) is well-loved and gotten a lot of traction.
- **issue tracker**: [GitHub issue tracker](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).
- **diagrams**: [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/).
- **AVOID**: if you see Jira on a startup‚Äôs list of tools, run away, run away! üëª 

**methodology**

- **agile**: basically, anything but waterfall will get you where you want to be going. a cadence of 6-weeks from idea to launch is probably good time for things to bake but can vary for your team and project. check out [this takeaway](http://blog.crisp.se/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/SpotifyScaling.pdf) on how Spotify scaled agile at their company with the concept of tribes, squads, chapters, and guilds. here‚Äôs a [comparison](https://www.smartsheet.com/agile-vs-scrum-vs-waterfall-vs-kanban) of various workflows.
- **RACI framework**: figure out who is **R**esponsible, **A**ccountable, **C**onsulted, and **I**nformed. this helps give clarity to of ownership in a project. an overview is found [here](https://medium.com/@ggiiaa/when-lack-of-clarity-is-killing-your-teams-effectiveness-raci-for-startups-5e85a5ef9931).


## consistency

to preserve sanity with others you work with, pick a coding style and stick with it.

- **code review**: here are some [great guidelines](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/) on how to give great code reviews.
- **styleguide**: picks a default set of conventions to code in.
    - [Airbnb JS Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
    - [Airbnb CSS Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/css)
    - [Airbnb CSS in JavaScript](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/css-in-javascript)
    - Google styleguides: [JS](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javascriptguide.xml), [JS coding conventions](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html), [CSS](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html)
- **linters**:
    - **code quality**: [ESLint](https://eslint.org/). catches issues with bugs in your code.
    - **formatting**: [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). catches issues related to how the code is formatted. available for many languages, notably JS and CSS. also, you can add a library to do [import sorting](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier-plugin-import-sort) as well.
    npm install prettier --save-dev --save-exact
    npm install lint-staged husky --save-dev
    # add to package.json
    "husky": {
      "hooks": {
        "pre-commit": "lint-staged"
      }
    },
    "lint-staged": {
      "src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,json,css,scss,md}": [
        "prettier --single-quote --write",
        "git add"
      ]
    },
- **versioning**: [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). when creating a new version of your app try to use consistent versioning.
- **language**: using a tool like [alex](https://alexjs.com/) can help make sure you are using equitable, fair, and inclusive language.


## documentation

some would say that this section would come first. in some ways they‚Äôre right, since documentation tends to unfortunately be an afterthought for a lot of projects. lucky for you there are some tools to get over that ugh-can‚Äôt-someone-else-do-this-inertia.

- [**Docusaurus**](https://docusaurus.io/): use Markdown and React to create your project‚Äôs docs.
- [**Read the Docs**](https://readthedocs.org/): use Markdown and CLI to generate your project‚Äôs docs.

for an inspirational view into how one company open-sourced their documentation check out Artsy:

- [Artsy Engineering GitHub](https://github.com/artsy/readme/)
- [Open Source by Default: Docs](http://artsy.github.io/blog/2018/08/21/OSS-by-Default-Docs/)


## website

the ever classic way to get visibility and get your product out there is creating a site. an easy way to do this is to take advantage of [**GitHub Pages**](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/). it‚Äôll let you quickly let you get a page up for your project.


## support

various ways to show love for your work these days:

- [**Buy me a coffee**](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/)
- [**Patreon**](https://www.patreon.com/)
- [**Open Collective**](https://opencollective.com/)


## newbies

if you have someone new to the team, you would do well to:

- help them get setup on their laptop
- show them documentation
- hook them up with communication access (slack, email, etc.)
- **super important**: commit code the first day!! have some trivial task that has the newbie commit code even if it‚Äôs just adding their name to an about page. this will probably tick a lot of boxes in getting them setup.


## a word on open source

just do it. to paraphrase [Bill Murray](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080487/quotes/qt0484920): "oh, uh, there won't be any money, but when you die, on your deathbed, you will receive total consciousness." so you‚Äôll have that goin‚Äô for you, which is nice.

# continuous integration / continuous deployment (CI/CD)

as your team grows, it will seem that the velocity of your project will slow. part of this is inevitable as you have more communication and coordination to help enable. but, you can help keep some of that speed by using a CI server to allow your developers to continually push new features to your app without fear (mostly) that they will take down production.

the recommendation here is [**Github Actions**](https://github.com/features/actions). to get started on how Github Actions works i recommend looking at [**Github Actions By Example**](https://actionsbyexample.com/) for a quick primer.

other products in this space are [**Travis CI**](https://www.travis-ci.com/). i also hear good things about is [**Danger JS**](https://danger.systems/js/), which adds common code review chores to GitHub pull requests.


## staging / canary servers

if you have the ability to do so, a staging or canary server is highly recommended. this is a server that you can use internally to ‚Äúdogfood‚Äù your application before it goes out to the general public. testing can catch a lot of things but sometimes new classes of errors can only crop up with real-world use.
