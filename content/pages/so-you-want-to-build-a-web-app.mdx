*a discerning guide to showing you the ropes.*

# brief intro

this guide is my 🌱 living 🌱, ever-evolving guide on how to build a web app, since it really has been changing at a breakneck speed as long as i can remember. the idea behind this guide is to synthesize in one coherent place the myriad pieces you need to combine and understand to create a web application these days. the guide follows sort of the idea of “assess, analyze, adopt, avoid” that you may have seen in other tech landscape documents, with obviously my personal opinion on matters.
