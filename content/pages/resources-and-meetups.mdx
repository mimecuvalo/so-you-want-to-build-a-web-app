> Shawn Wang coined a term for a new stack this year: [STAR](https://css-tricks.com/star-apps-a-new-generation-of-front-end-tooling-for-development-workflows/) or Design System, TypeScript, Apollo, and React. This is incredible to me, not just because I kind of like that stack, but because it’s a way of talking about the stack powering a website that is entirely front-end technologies. Quite a shift.
